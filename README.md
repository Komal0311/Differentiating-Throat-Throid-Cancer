# Differentiating-Throat-Throid-Cancer
##Description
Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy . Multiple histological types of thyroid cancer have been described, including papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). PTC, the well-differentiated type, accounts for more than 80% of all thyroid cancers and has a clinically favorable prognosis with more than 90% 10-year disease-specific survival.


#About the dataset
This data set contains 13 clinicopathologic features aiming to predict recurrence of well differentiated thyroid cancer. The data set was collected in duration of 15 years and each patient was followed for at least 10 years.

**Adenopathy Column:**
*This makes it clear that "No" means no lymph adenopathy, and specifies whether the adenopathy is on the left or right side of the body or if it is extensive and widespread.*

**Stage Column:**
*This replaces Roman numeral stage indicators with descriptive text indicating the progression stage of the thyroid condition.*

**Tumor Column:**
*These replacements clarify the size and extent of the tumor, making the clinical staging information more descriptive and accessible.*

**Lymph Nodes Column:**
*This describes the extent of lymph node involvement, indicating whether there is no metastasis or if metastasis is present, specifying its location.*

**Cancer Metastasis Column:**
*This specifies whether there is evidence of cancer spreading to distant parts of the body.*

###**Comparison and Relation:**

**General Trend:** Both plots indicate that as the severity of the condition (whether by tumor size or cancer stage) increases, the median age of patients also tends to increase. This might suggest that older patients are more likely to have advanced stages of thyroid conditions.

**Age Distribution:** There is a wide range of ages at each stage, but more advanced stages show higher median ages. This pattern is consistent across both types of staging.

**Outliers:** Outliers in both plots indicate variability in ages, with some older patients appearing in earlier stages and vice versa.
Conclusion:
The boxplots visually represent the relationship between patient age and the progression of thyroid conditions. They show that more advanced stages, whether by tumor size or cancer stage, generally correspond to higher median ages, highlighting a potential link between patient age and the severity of the condition.
